        A kitchen utensil is a small hand held tool used for food preparation.
        Common kitchen tasks include cutting food items to size, heating food on
        an open fire or on a stove, baking, grinding, mixing, blending, and
        measuring; different utensils are made for each task. A general purpose
        utensil such as a chef's knife may be used for a variety of foods; other
        kitchen utensils are highly specialized and may be used only in
        connection with preparation of a particular type of food, such as an egg
        separator or an apple corer.
